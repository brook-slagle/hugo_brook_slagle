### What I am looking into right now going into spring: 
- Minimization
- The Spotify API for creating playlists...
- Mens gymnastics strength skills; starting with the humble False Grip


### What I learned since [What I Am Looking Into - December 2023]( {{< ref "/what-i-am-looking-into-december-22.md" >}})

#### Cold Exposure
I got into this because of the hype train on social media. I decided to take the plunge (ha) and start taking cold showers and eventually built up to a full plunge. Being just in my bathtub, it wasn't ideal... but in the depths of South Dakota winter, the water was cold enough, ~37 degrees F. 

And it was worth it. Though there are some differences between the shower and full immersive plunge. A cold shower is taxing, terrible, and down-right difficult in comparison to the plunge. The plunge sucked at the start but became incredibly relaxing and rejuvinating as time went on, where as the shower is constantly hard from start to finish. 

From my research, the golden number of minutes per week to meet the minimum effective dose (MED) was 11 mins. You net increased dopeamine, alertness, recovery, brownfat thermogensis and mental toughness. I followed this time recommendation and did it for about 3 months, often did more than 11mins per week as I was primarily doing cold showers. And I believe that you do net some benefits if you do a cold shower vs full water immersion. When doing immersion, your body gets significatnly colder in a shorter period of time vs a shower. According to Dr. Andy Galpin, cold shower's aren't as effective, but I personally believe that cold showers build mental toughness more than cold plunges. 

Having a dedicated cold plunge would be pretty dope.

#### Habit Tracking utilizing Obsidian and it's Dataview and Projects plugins.
Obsidian is one of my favorite apps of all time, and using it for habit tracking is one of the more difficult tasks that I have given it. It isn't inherently good at it, so utilizing the plugins, I had to build it to work for me. 

The Projects plugin has two different options when building out a 'project' in it. I need to utilize Dataview queries as I build in my dataview fields within my Daily Notes. For example: 
```
---
date: 2023-03-22
---

Weight::
Steps::
... etc
```
With that, then I would create a project and have a table (keep in mind this works with regular Dataview plugin, but the projects interface is just a bit cleaner):
```
TABLE
file.link as "File",
date as "Date",
Weight AS "Weight",
Steps AS "Steps", 
... etc
```

With that you get something like this:

#### Readwise Reader and maximizing my usage of twitter (and it's threads) as a positive tool.
