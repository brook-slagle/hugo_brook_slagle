# Welcome to my person website :D
This is a personal project of mine using hugo to manage my content. This doubles as my person blog and resume/portfolio. Given the nature of this website, I wanted it to be simple and clean, and very fast (thx hugo).

TODO:
- [x] ~~fix the damn footer~~
- [ ] add more content
- [x] ~~fix the weird conclusion making a title in .md~~
- [ ] update the about me page with something relevant and a picture
- [x] ~~make list pages look better~~
