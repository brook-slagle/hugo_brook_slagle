DSU students, be aware. Madison does not have a *whole lot* to offer. You might enjoy the *tiny* party scene, or maybe you're a bar hopper, but you'll always inevitably end up the only food place that is open past midnight. (And that would be the good ole' Classic Corner where you will indulge in Hot Stuff Pizza.) 

Now the rest of the time you enjoying your time in Madison, you will likely be thinking *"Huh, I am tired of TC Marketplace food, where do I go?"* Use this blog post as a reference to your culinary adventure through Madtowns offerings. 

#### Here are all of the food places in the area:
*Chains*
- McDonalds
- Dairy Queen
- Subway
- Hot Stuff Pizza
- Pizza Ranch
- Scooters Coffee
- Casey's

*Local*
- The Office
- El Vaquero
- Los Tapatios
- Second Street Diner
- China Moon
- Stadium Sports Grill
- Country Cafe
- Taste & See Fresh Kitchen
- Sundog Coffee
- Nicky's
- COWS -N- Canoes Country Mercantile
- One Stop Gas Station (Subs)
- Prime Time Tavern
- Sporty's Bar

I will say, none of the options above are bad. I think that they each hold a purpose in this town and have a good following, but some have competition that is down-right superior or do something better and it is just enough to make a difference. Okay...

#### Now here are all of the food places worth their snuff: 
*Chains*
- McDonalds (cheapest food in town while using the app, have to leave it in here)
- Dairy Queen (ice cream, c'mon)
- Hot Stuff Pizza (can't beat the 2am chicken and pizza)
- Caseys (best "normal" pizza)

*Local*
- The Office (best pizza)
- El Vaquero (*probably the best food in Madison (in my opinion of course)*.  I prefer El Vaq over Los Tapatios, but both are great.)
- Second Street Diner (good classic diner, better hours and more choices but not as good food compared to Country Cafe)
- China Moon (good chinese buffet, great value)
- Stadium Sports Grill (probably the best burger in town)
- Country Cafe (great hole-in-the-wall location, best diner food in town but less availability hours wise)
- Sundog Coffee (hands down best coffee shop in town, plus they have boba and good sando's)
- One Stop Gas Station (best subs, especially for the price)
- Sporty's Bar (best wings in town)
