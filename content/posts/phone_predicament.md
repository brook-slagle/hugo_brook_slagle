I want to buy a new phone eventually, but there is no flagship phones with aux ports. So I have to choose whether I want to upgrade my phone AND fully invest in true-wireless headphones again, or keep my old poodunky Samsung S10 and keep the aux port while using my analog cans. 

Options: 
1. Buy new phone: 
	- Which phone would I buy? 
		- iPhone 14 Pro. ~$1000 - Trade in = ~$900 😩
		- Pixel 7 Pro. ~$900 - Trade in = ~$650 
	- What headphones would I use? 
		- airpods pro 2nd gen
		- Honorbuds pro3 for the android option…
	- 👍 Great tech
	- 👍 Awesome cameras
	- 👍 more reliabilty going forward. 
	- 👎 Expensive
	- 👎 consumerist-ish
	- 👎 heavy transition if I were to go with apple's ecosystem. would likely have to go with a macbook pro in the future (which to be fair I want to anyways…)
2. Keep old phone
	- What a love I have for the old aux port, but it's dying anyways. 
	- Save money. A good bit of money.
