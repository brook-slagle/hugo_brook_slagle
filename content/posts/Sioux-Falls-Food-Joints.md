## Quick Top 5: 
1. 

#### Camille's Sidewalk Cafe - *3.5/5*

#### Watecha Bowl - *4.5/5*
- This is a real sioux falls jem. Native American Indian Food. We ordered a regular watecha bowl and a watecha bison burger. I would like to say that this is the first time of having any sort of Native/Indina food. The Indian frybread has got to be some of the best breadlike food I have ever had, an absolute gem. 

#### Burger Time - *3.5/5*
- Great Smashburger joint. 

#### Sickies Garage Burgers & Brews - *4.3/5*

#### Pizzashop - *4/5*
- The Napoli calzone was ridiciousloy cheese. The most cheesy thing I have ever had in my life. Riccota, Mozzarella and pepperoni were playing dice in my stomach it was so much. WAY too much cheese. The calzone was 1.5/5 literally too much cheese. The the pizza was great. Real New York Style pizza 4.5/5.

#### Oshima Sushi Japanese *4.5/5*

#### Firehouse Subs *3.5/5*
- Itialian sub: Everything was great about it except, there was an underlying sweet hint within something. Bread to meat ratio was fantastic, the meaty advertisements are accurate.
