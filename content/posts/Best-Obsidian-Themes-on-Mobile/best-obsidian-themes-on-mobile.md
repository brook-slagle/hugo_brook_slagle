Like most users of Obsidian, we go down this rabbit hole of trying out every decent looking theme. And that is exactly what I did for mobile compatible themes. And I did this so you don't have to, because it's a fun and terrible process at the same time. 

One of the biggest problem with most of the mobile themes on Obsidian is the size of the menus and navigation. The note taking experience is fine and probably looks great on 90% of themes, but whenever you need to swap to a different note or use the search feature, the text/button size is unreasonably large. And this makes using Obsidian on mobile rather clunky and the opposite of the desktop experience which is viciously smooth. 

The following themes all share a similar design concept of decluttering the UI and making it aptly sized to maximized the usability. These themes make using Obsidian on mobile great.  Here are my (personal opinion of course) favorite themes for mobile usage: 

## Sanctum 
This is my personal favorite theme on all of Obsidian, not just on mobile. It is based off of the IBM Carbon Design System and utilizes their font IBM Plex. It maximizes usability and removes the unnecessary clutter that comes with mobile usage.

It also works wonderfully with the Style Settings plugin and can utilize a true black color pallete for those with an OLED display to save some battery life.

## Minimal
One of, if not the most popular theme on Obsidian and for good reason. This theme is highly customizable and offers one of the most clean and elegant experiences Obsidian themes can offer. Based off its name, minimalism is the core concept of this themes design. 

With usage of the Style Settings plugin, you can customize nearly every little thing that you interact with from the theme. Again, this offers a true black setting so you can not burn your eyes at night and save battery. 


## Things

## Obsidian You 
Obsidian You is a special theme because it is (as far as I know) the only theme that is designed, from the ground up, for mobile usage. With that said, it does a pretty good job at that. The menus are smooth and you can tell its optimized. 

The style settings plugin is
