### Firstly, hello :D

This blog is going to be filled with a plethora of things... 
a little introduction. I am Brook, a student at DSU who lives life to the fullest. You can find out more about me at my [about be](https://brookslagle.com/about_me/) and if you are interested in my work history and projects, check out my [portfolio](https://brookslagle.com/portfolio).

This site will be a constant work in progress and I hope to post semi-often :D.

Thanks for checking it out!
