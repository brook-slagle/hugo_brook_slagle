Like most users of Obsidian, we go down this rabbit hole of trying out every decent looking theme. And that is exactly what I did for mobile compatible themes. And I did this so you don't have to, because it's a fun and terrible process at the same time. 
 
One of the biggest problem with most of the mobile themes on Obsidian is the size of the menus and navigation. The note taking experience is fine and probably looks great on 90% of themes, but whenever you need to swap to a different note or use the search feature, the text/button size is usually unreasonably large. This makes using Obsidian on mobile rather clunky and the opposite of the desktop experience which is viciously smooth. 

### How to install a theme in Obsidian on mobile:

The following themes all share a similar design concept of decluttering the UI and making it aptly sized to maximized the usability. These themes make using Obsidian on mobile great.  Here are my [personal opinion of course] favorite themes for mobile usage: 

## Sanctum 
My personal favorite theme on all of Obsidian is [Sanctum](https://github.com/jdanielmourao/obsidian-sanctum), not just on mobile, but for desktop usage as well. It is based off of the IBM Carbon Design System and utilizes their font IBM Plex. It maximizes usability and removes the unnecessary clutter that comes with mobile usage. It is an absolute joy to use, and it is the only theme that I found to be better than Minimal. 

It also works wonderfully with the Style Settings plugin and can utilize a true black color pallete for those with an OLED display to save some battery life.

## Minimal
[Minimal](https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-minimal) is one of, if not the most popular theme on Obsidian and for good reason. Based off its name, minimalism is the core concept of this themes design. It is highly customizable and offers one of the most clean and elegant experiences Obsidian themes can offer. I was using this theme for quite a long time and rightly so, it is incredibly well optimized and is a wonderful starting place for those just getting Obsidian themes. 

With usage of the Style Settings plugin, you can customize nearly every little thing that you interact with from the theme. Again, this offers a true black setting so you can not burn your eyes at night and save battery.

## Things
The [Things](https://github.com/colineckert/obsidian-things) theme for Obsidian is based on the OSX/IOS app [Things 3](https://culturedcode.com/things/). It's colors are clean and cool with focus on hues of blue with accents of red and green. It quite user-friendly and responsive, the menues are clean and are not overly cluttered with pointless icons. All of this creates a comfortable experience on mobile. This is the closest I felt to vanilla obsidian just with an improved UI and color set.  

[Things](https://github.com/colineckert/obsidian-things) does offer extensive customizability within the style settings plugin, with the majority leaning towards typography and fonts.

## Obsidian You 
[Obsidian You](https://github.com/selfire1/obsidian-you-theme) is a special theme because it is [as far as I know] the only theme that is designed, from the ground up, for mobile usage. With that said, it does a pretty good job at that. Being based off of Google's Material Design system, the menus are smooth and you can tell its optimized. Personally, I am not the biggest fan of Google Material design, but it is **MILES** better than the default mobile theme. 

There is very little utilization of the Style Settings plugin for this theme. It allows you to change your font and a some other things that aren't that impactful.

## In conclusion...
You really can't go wrong with *most* of the themes on Obsidian, especially because this list is ***ENTIRELY SUBJECTIVE***. While I do think that making the font size smaller and decluttering the UI making an objectively more enjoyable experience, there are instances where those who are hard of sight could need increased size. Take this with a grain of salt, and I encourage you to browse the Obsidian Community Themes and make your own decision! Finding something that works for you will yield the best experience for you üëç.
